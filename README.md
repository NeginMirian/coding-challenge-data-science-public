# Data Science Coding Challenge
Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key components:

data/: Contains the SQLite database (tickets.db) with historical ticket sales data.

src/: Contains the core Python scripts for data handling, forecasting, and validation:

data_handler.py: Handles loading data from the SQLite database.

forecasting.py: Implements the forecasting logic using Prophet.

validation.py: Validates the model by splitting data into training and testing sets.

main.py: The main script that orchestrates the workflow.

forecast_results_2022_2023.csv: The output file containing the forecasted ticket sales.

The forecast results include:
Date (ds): The forecasted date.

Predicted Sales (yhat): The predicted daily ticket sales.

Lower Bound (yhat_lower): The lower confidence interval for the prediction.

Upper Bound (yhat_upper): The upper confidence interval for the prediction.

Model Choice:
Prophet was chosen because it handles seasonality and trends well, which are important for ski ticket sales.
Validation:
The model was validated by splitting data into training (2016â€“2021) and testing (2022), and the accuracy was measured using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Next Steps
If given more time, we could improve the project by:

Incorporating external factors like weather data or holidays.

Tuning the model hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

Automating the validation process to refine the model further.
